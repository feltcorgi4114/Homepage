This website was created to just express some of the the knowledge I gained about programming from the CS50x lectures as well as from the first couple of weeks from the CS50w lectures.

This website consists of 4 html web pages; them being,
    1. index.html
    2. clockAndLocation.html   
    3. table.html
    4. about.html

All the required languages (html, css and scss) as well as JavaScript were used to make the website more functional, interactive, and aesthetic.

1) Index.html
    - Shows 3 cards, which I designed myself (not using Bootstrap's card component), displaying some           information about the programming languages C, Python, and JavaScript.

2) clockAndLocation.html
    - Displays 2 buttons, which allows the user to find out their system's time, and find their location on google maps respectively.

3) table.html
    - Displays a center-aligned table containing my most favourite programming languages, with their respective code editor(s) that I prefer, also including the company which developed the application.

4) about.html
    - Displays information about me, and any disclaimers for content on this site.
